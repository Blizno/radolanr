Description: This package offers functions to read radolan data and to
    create information of spatial and temporal variability of rain. Processes are offered for
    sites given as points or polygons given as shape files. Find two
    usecases in the github reposiory. First creating timeseries of radolan
    data and compare it with data measured by weather stations. Second usecase estimates
    spatial distribution of rainfall at points of interest given in a
    polygonlayer. Find more information here in the github repository.
